# Research Bot for URL-Based Data Summarization and Insight Extraction
This project provides a robust research bot designed to assist users in summarizing and extracting meaningful insights from multiple URLs. 
By leveraging the capabilities of advanced text processing and vector storage, the bot ensures efficient data handling and insightful responses.

## Project Overview
The Research Bot accepts multiple URL inputs from a user, processes the text data, and provides insightful summaries using OpenAI services. 
The workflow involves loading data from URLs, splitting the data into manageable chunks, storing the data in a FAISS vector database, and responding to user prompts with accurate and concise summaries.
